# Deployment Guide - Edinburgh Concierge

## Quick Start (5 minutes with Netlify)

This is the **easiest** way to share your app with friends.

This creates a `dist` folder with your production-ready app.

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up (free)
2. Click "Add new site" â†’ "Deploy manually"
3. Drag and drop your `dist` folder
4. Done! You'll get a URL like: `https://lord-lord-edinburgh.netlify.app`

### Step 3: Customize Your URL (Optional)

1. In Netlify, go to "Site settings" â†’ "Change site name"
2. Choose something like `edinburgh-guide` or `lord-lord-edin`
3. Your new URL: `https://edinburgh-guide.netlify.app`

## Continuous Deployment (Auto-update from GitHub)

If you want your app to automatically update when you push changes:

### Setup with Netlify + GitHub:

1. Push your code to GitHub:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/edinburgh-concierge.git
git push -u origin main
```

2. In Netlify:
   - Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Click "Deploy"

3. Now every time you push to GitHub, Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy!

## Testing on Mobile Before Deployment

### Test on iPhone/iPad:

1. While `npm run dev` is running, find your computer's local IP:
   - Mac: System Preferences â†’ Network
   - Should be something like `192.168.1.x`

2. Update Vite to expose the server:
```bash
npm run dev -- --host
```

3. On your iPhone/iPad (connected to same WiFi):
   - Open Safari
   - Go to `http://192.168.1.x:3000` (use your actual IP)

## Sharing Tips

### For Best Experience:

**iPhone Users:**
1. Open the link in Safari
2. Tap the Share button (square with arrow)
3. Tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. The app now works like a native app!

**Android Users:**
1. Open in Chrome
2. Tap the menu (three dots)
3. Tap "Add to Home screen"

## Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want `edinburgh.guide` instead of `*.netlify.app`:

1. Buy a domain from Namecheap, Google Domains, etc. (~$10-15/year)
2. In Netlify: "Domain settings" â†’ "Add custom domain"
3. Update your domain's DNS settings (Netlify provides instructions)
4. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
