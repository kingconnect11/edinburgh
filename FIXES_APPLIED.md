# Fixes Applied - Edinburgh Concierge

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Wrong File Being Used
**Problem:** You were editing `edinburgh_concierge-2.tsx` in the root folder, but the app actually runs `src/App.tsx`.

**Solution:** Integrated all Claude AI features directly into the correct file (`src/App.tsx`).

### 2. ✅ Scroll Image Not Displaying
**Problem:** The `knightly_itinerary.png` image wasn't showing up in the itinerary view.

**Solution:**
- Copied image to `src/` folder for proper Vite import
- Added image import: `import knightlyItinerary from './knightly_itinerary.png'`
- Created beautiful overlay display in the itinerary view

### 3. ✅ Concierge Not Using Claude AI
**Problem:** The concierge chat was using basic keyword matching instead of Claude AI.

**Solution:**
- Created `src/claudeAPI.ts` with TypeScript types
- Added `generateConciergeResponse()` function with humorous British butler personality
- Integrated Claude AI into the chat with graceful fallback
- Added loading indicator: "Your butler is thinking..."

## What Now Works

### 🤖 Claude AI Concierge Chat
- Real-time AI-powered responses in British butler style
