# Edinburgh Concierge - Getting Started Guide

*A Brief Introduction from Your Humble Servant*

---

## Welcome, M'Lord

Good day, Sir. Allow me to introduce you to your personal Edinburgh Concierge—a digital companion of impeccable taste and questionable humor, at your service for navigating the finest establishments in Dùn Èideann.

The application awaits you at: **[scottishbutler.netlify.app](https://scottishbutler.netlify.app)**

## How to Use Your Concierge

### The Main Menu (The Slate)
Upon arrival, you'll be greeted by a circular menu presenting six categories of establishments:

- **Drinks** - Cocktail bars, whisky lounges, and liquid sophistication
- **Meals** - Fine dining and restaurants of distinction
- **Quick Bites** - Casual fare when time is of the essence
- **Huzz** - Nightlife, entertainment, and revelry
- **Free** - Complimentary attractions and experiences
- **Hotels** - Luxurious accommodations for when the evening goes... well

Simply tap a category to browse curated venues, or consult me directly via the **Concierge** button.

### The Guide (The Book)
Browse venues by category with full details including:
- Descriptions and tags
- Price ranges
- Operating hours
- Customer reviews
- Direct navigation to Google Maps

Add venues to your evening's itinerary with a simple tap.

### The Concierge Chat (The Scroll)
Ah, my personal domain. Engage me in conversation, and I shall:
- Recommend establishments based on your desires
- Suggest logical progressions (cocktails → dinner → hotel, if you're fortunate)
- Handle requests with wit and occasional impropriety
- Confirm your plans when you say "sounds good" or similar affirmations

**Important Note:** When you confirm your selections, I shall provide brief well wishes, and your chosen venues will automatically populate in "Tonight's Itinerary."

### Tonight's Itinerary
Your evening's plan, complete with:
- All selected venues
- A butler-crafted description of your night
- Google Maps integration for navigation
- Share and export features

## A Word of Caution, Sir

While I am delighted to serve, I must confess that each exchange in our chat carries a modest expense—the cost of employing my considerable artificial intelligence. Think of it as tipping your butler, if you will.

**Therefore, please exercise discretion when sharing access to this application.** Share it only with those worthy of your trust and hospitality. We wouldn't want just anyone running up your tab, now would we? Perhaps friends of distinction rather than, shall we say, freeloading rabble.

## Features at Your Disposal

- **Share & Export**: Send your plans to companions or save for posterity
- **Atmospheric Experience**: Background music and butler commentary

## A Spot of Advice

1. **Start with a Goal**: "I need a cocktail bar for a date" works better than "show me stuff"
2. **Trust the Process**: I'll guide you through the evening's flow—drinks, dinner, and beyond
3. **Confirm When Ready**: Say "sounds good" or "let's do it" and I'll finalize your plans
4. **Check the Details**: View hours and directions before venturing out
5. **Mind the Costs**: Remember, my witty banter isn't free (see "Word of Caution" above)

## Off-Menu Requests

Should you inquire about an establishment not in our curated collection, I shall endeavor to provide what knowledge I possess. However, if I know nothing of the place, I may gently suggest it's beneath you and recommend something more suitable. It's what any good butler would do.

## In Closing

This application was crafted with care, a touch of absurdity, and considerable Scottish charm. May it serve you well on your adventures through Edinburgh's finest establishments.

Should you require anything further, simply tap the concierge button and engage me in conversation. I await your commands with bated breath and a perfectly pressed waistcoat.
