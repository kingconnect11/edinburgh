## Next Steps

### 1. Adding Your 100+ Venues

**Prompt for your other agent:**

```
Please create a JSON file with 100+ Edinburgh venues following this exact format:

[
  {
    "name": "Venue Name",
    "category": "drinks",  // Options: "drinks", "meals", "quick-bites", "huzz", "free"
    "address": "Full Edinburgh address",
    "lat": 55.9533,  // Get from Google Maps
    "lng": -3.1883,   // Get from Google Maps
    "priceRange": 2,   // 0=free, 1=Â£, 2=Â£Â£, 3=Â£Â£Â£
    "tags": ["cozy", "romantic", "fireplace"],  // 2-5 descriptive tags
    "hours": {
      "mon": "12:00-23:00",
      "tue": "12:00-23:00",
      "wed": "12:00-23:00",
      "thu": "12:00-23:00",
      "fri": "12:00-01:00",
      "sat": "12:00-01:00",
      "sun": "12:00-22:00"
    },
    "reviews": [
      "Short punchy review quote",
      "Another review quote"
    ],
    "description": "One compelling sentence describing the venue"
  }
]

Save this as new-venues.json

Guidelines:
- category must be one of: "drinks", "meals", "quick-bites", "huzz", "free"
- priceRange: 0 (free), 1 (under Â£10), 2 (Â£10-30), 3 (Â£30+)
- tags: lowercase with hyphens (e.g., "live-music", "dog-friendly")
- hours: 24-hour format or "closed"
- Get accurate lat/lng from Google Maps by right-clicking the location
```

**Then import them:**
1. Save the JSON file as `new-venues.json` in the project root
2. Copy the venues array from the JSON
3. Paste into `src/data/venues.ts` replacing or adding to `VENUES_DATA`

### 2. Test Locally

The development server is already running at:
**http://localhost:3000**

Open this in your browser to test the app.

### 3. Deploy to Share with Friends

**Easiest Method (5 minutes):**

```bash
# Build the app
npm run build

# This creates a 'dist' folder
```

Then:
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) (sign up free)
2. Drag and drop the `dist` folder
3. Get your live URL (e.g., https://lord-lord-edinburgh.netlify.app)
4. Share with friends!

See `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions and other deployment options.

### 4. Mobile Testing

**To test on your iPhone before deploying:**

```bash
npm run dev -- --host
```

Then on your iPhone (same WiFi):
- Open Safari
- Go to `http://YOUR-COMPUTER-IP:3000`
- (Find your IP in System Preferences â†’ Network)

## Sharing with Friends

Once deployed, users can:

1. **Use in Browser**: Just open the URL
2. **Add to Home Screen** (recommended):
   - iOS: Safari â†’ Share â†’ Add to Home Screen
   - Android: Chrome â†’ Menu â†’ Add to Home screen
   - App now works like a native app!

## Customization Ideas

### Easy Wins:
1. Update the title from "Lord Lord" to your preferred name (search `index.html` and `App.tsx`)
2. Add more venue categories (update `CATEGORIES` array in `App.tsx`)
3. Enhance the concierge with better keyword matching
4. Add venue photos to cards

### Advanced:
1. Connect to a real AI API for concierge (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
2. Add user authentication to save itineraries
3. Implement venue search functionality
4. Add filters (price range, tags, open now, etc.)
5. Integrate real-time opening hours from Google Places API
